Purpose: The purpose of this project was to write a program for stdlinux that lists all the running processes on the system and then 
terminates them using a GUI. The inspiration of this project came from the Microsoft task manager that does a similar thing but something 
like that does not exist for Linux.

Instructions to run the code:

Step 1. Install latest version of Java. (Previous version will probably still work)

Step 2. Once in the directory, run the make command.

Step 3. Finally run “make run” command and this will display a new window with list of processes which you can select and terminate.
